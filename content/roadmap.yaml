  - sectionTitle: Veni
    sectionContent: "If you're tired of rug pulls and celebrity endorsed nonsense, you've come to the right place. Not long ago, our team was similar to some of yourselves looking to embark into the NFT realm. Our Roadmap is based on the ideologies of Julius Caesar: Veni, Vidi, Vici (I came, I saw, I conquered). In this first phase we will be focusing on building our family by having a giveaway here and there as a taste of the full experience. With our all-star team in place and a base community built, we are looking to enhance the NFT space with more than just artwork."
    sectionSummary:
      - Community Building
      - Giveaways - Free GabaGhouls NFTs & ETH drops
      - Website Launch

  - sectionTitle: Vidi
    sectionContent: "In this second phase we will be launching our first public Mint: The Smorgasbord Drop 7/9/2022. This drop will consist of 7500 GabaGhouls. By purchasing a GabaGhoul you will not only receive a cute or spooky companion but access to giveaways, clothing merchandise, and exclusive events as well! We could not claim to be an Italian-inspired project if we did not put the family first. The community that we are sculpting is our priority and will be the pillar to our success. "

    sectionContent: 'Our final phase is Vici: "I conquered. The mission is to raise “the floor” for our family. Community engagement is at the forefront of the continued success and enjoyment of our project. Holders will be able to participate in polls which will allow the community to decide on different benefits such as giveaways, events, and other decision making aspects of our roadmap. The parent bullet points are items we intend to tackle. We will be prioritizing these bullet points based on family feedback and initial community membership. As the NFT space is always changing we will be updating our goals as well, both with the real world and metaverse in mind. '
