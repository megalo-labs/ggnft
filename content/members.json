      "memberName": "Dennis",
      "memberRole": "Community Outreach",
      "memberDescription": "With family ties to the beautiful grape farms of Sicily, Dennis is the Italian of the group. His papa did not embrace his heritage so he took it upon himself to learn the tricks of the trade. GabaGhouls is his way of expressing his love for Italian culture, while also cultivating an inclusive community, and having a great time doing it. Nicknamed D-Nice, he has had numerous viral TikToks and creates videos about his passions including hair loss, men's health, self care, and side hustles. During the day he is a (mad) scientist working on life saving gene therapy medicines. His free time also involves being a gym junkie, spitting fire raps, and hanging with the boys."
